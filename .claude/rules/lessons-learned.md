## Error Patterns and Fixes

<!-- Entries are auto-appended by the PostToolUseFailure hook -->
<!-- After fixing an issue, update the Status from NEEDS_FIX to RESOLVED and add the fix description -->

### Error: git checkout <old-sha> -- . re-added deleted files (2026-04-21T22:30:00Z)
- **Tool:** Bash
- **Input:** `git stash; git checkout 733ee9c -- .; pnpm check:plugin-schema; git checkout HEAD -- .`
- **Error:** `git checkout <sha> -- .` restored all files from that commit into the working tree AND index, including files that had been `git rm`'d at HEAD. A follow-up `git checkout HEAD -- .` did not un-stage or un-restore them — they remained as "new file:" entries, inflating the next commit.
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Fix:** Ran `git reset HEAD` to unstage, then `rm -rf <files>` on the restored working-tree copies. Working tree returned to clean HEAD state.
- **Prevention:** To diff/test against an older commit without mutating HEAD, use `git worktree add ../tmp-baseline <sha>` and run the comparison in the temp worktree — never `git checkout <sha> -- .` on the live worktree. If you must, record the exact file set at HEAD first (e.g. `git ls-files > /tmp/head-files`) and prune anything extra after reverting.


### Error: Bash failure (2026-02-24T08:18:00Z)
- **Tool:** Bash
- **Input:** `python3 << 'PYEOF' ... (background agent writing scripts to old rosa-microsoft-deploy path)`
- **Error:** FileNotFoundError: rosa-microsoft-deploy directory no longer exists (renamed to tvs-microsoft-deploy)
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Fix:** Background agent retained old path from initial prompt. Scripts already exist at tvs-microsoft-deploy/scripts/.
- **Prevention:** Stop all background agents before renaming directories. Background agents cannot detect mid-flight path changes.

### Error: Bash redirection in for loop
- **Tool:** Bash
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Fix:** `for f in "$dir"*.md 2>/dev/null` causes syntax error in bash eval
- **Prevention:** Use `find` or `ls | while read` instead of glob with redirection in for-in

### Error: Bash escapes `!=` in inline python
- **Tool:** Bash
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Fix:** Bash escapes `!` inside double-quoted strings. Use heredoc (`<< 'PYEOF'`) for multi-line python instead of inline `-c "..."`.
- **Prevention:** Always use heredoc for python scripts with `!=` or `!` operators.

### Error: EISDIR on directory path
- **Tool:** Read
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Fix:** Use `ls` or `Glob` for directories, `Read` for files only
- **Prevention:** Always check if path is a file before using Read tool

### Error: mcp__firecrawl__firecrawl_scrape failure (2026-02-28T01:18:10Z)
- **Tool:** mcp__firecrawl__firecrawl_scrape
- **Input:** `N/A`
- **Error:** Tool 'firecrawl_scrape' execution failed: Maximum number of redirects exceeded
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Fix:** Firecrawl hit redirect limit on target URL. Likely a redirect loop or bot-protection on the target site.
- **Prevention:** If firecrawl fails with redirect errors, try Perplexity MCP for the same information, or target a direct docs URL rather than a marketing/landing page.

### Error: git add on already-deleted files
- **Tool:** Bash
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Fix:** Files deleted with `git rm` are already staged; explicit `git add` fails with "pathspec did not match"
- **Prevention:** After `git rm`, use `git add -u` or just commit directly — don't re-add deleted files

### Error: Bash failure (2026-03-31T10:00:51Z)
- **Tool:** Bash
- **Input:** `cd C:/Users/MarkusAhling/pro/claude && git push origin main 2>&1`
- **Error:** Exit code 1

The stash entry is kept in case you need it again.
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Fix:** git stash pop encountered merge conflicts because the stashed changes conflicted with changes pulled from remote. The conflicts were in lessons-learned.md and claude-code-expert files. Resolved by manually editing the conflict markers in each file, then git add + git commit to complete the merge.
- **Prevention:** Before git stash pop, check if the pulled remote changes overlap with stashed files. If conflicts likely, resolve them one file at a time.

### Error: mcp__github__get_file_contents failure (2026-03-26T03:56:45Z)
- **Tool:** mcp__github__get_file_contents
- **Input:** `N/A`
- **Error:** Access denied: repository "mathews-tom/agentic-design-patterns" is not configured for this session. Allowed repositories: markus41/claude
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Fix:** WebFetch returned HTTP error (404/403/503) or content limit exceeded. URL was unavailable, moved, or access-restricted.
- **Prevention:** Use MCP tools instead of WebFetch: Perplexity MCP for knowledge queries, Firecrawl MCP for page scraping, Context7 MCP for library docs.

### Error: Bash failure (2026-03-08T09:15:54Z)
- **Tool:** Bash
- **Input:** `gh pr list --head claude/plugin-dev-2nziX --json number,title,url 2>&1`
- **Error:** Exit code 127
/bin/bash: line 1: gh: command not found

/bin/bash: line 1: gh: command not found
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Fix:** GitHub CLI (gh) was not installed, not authenticated, or restricted to allowed repos in the containerized environment.
- **Prevention:** In the current Windows environment, authenticate with: ! gh auth login. Only use GitHub MCP for allowed repos (markus41/claude).

### Error: mcp__github__resolve_review_thread failure (2026-03-27T06:10:34Z)
- **Tool:** mcp__github__resolve_review_thread
- **Input:** `N/A`
- **Error:** GitHub GraphQL error: GraphQL error: Could not resolve to a node with the global id of 'PRT_kwDOOYmw3s6XJG7l'.
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Fix:** WebFetch returned HTTP error (404/403/503) or content limit exceeded. URL was unavailable, moved, or access-restricted.
- **Prevention:** Use MCP tools instead of WebFetch: Perplexity MCP for knowledge queries, Firecrawl MCP for page scraping, Context7 MCP for library docs.

### Error: Bash failure (2026-03-14T16:34:26Z)
- **Tool:** Bash
- **Input:** `for f in commands/*.md; do echo "=== $(basename $f) ===" && grep -c "^| \`--" "$f" && echo "---"; done`
- **Error:** Exit code 1
=== analyze.md ===

### Error: heredoc grep confusion
- **Tool:** Bash
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Fix:** Complex heredoc scripts with pipes caused grep to treat shell arguments as file paths
- **Prevention:** Use simple sequential `cmd | grep` pipes, not embedded in heredoc blocks

### Error: JSON structure assumption
- **Tool:** Bash
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Fix:** commands.minimal.json `commands` field is a flat list, not a dict of categories. Check structure before assuming dict.
- **Prevention:** Always inspect JSON structure with `type()` check before calling `.items()` on it.

### Error: WebFetch failure (2026-03-26T03:55:55Z)
- **Tool:** WebFetch
- **Input:** `N/A`
- **Error:** maxContentLength size of 10485760 exceeded
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Fix:** File exceeded token limit. Use Read with offset/limit parameters to read specific sections, or Grep for targeted content search.
- **Prevention:** Before reading a large file, use Grep to search for specific content, or Read with offset/limit to access specific sections.

### Error: Exit code from ls on non-existent directory
- **Tool:** Bash
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Fix:** `2>/dev/null` suppresses stderr but exit code still propagates
- **Prevention:** Use `ls ... || true` when directory may not exist

### Error: Bash failure (2026-02-23T02:31:39Z)
- **Tool:** Bash
- **Input:** `ls /home/user/claude/.claude/tools/plugin-cli/src/ 2>/dev/null && echo "---" && ls /home/user/claude/.claude/tools/plugin-cli/src/commands/ 2>/dev/null`
- **Error:** Exit code 2

- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Fix:** Path from old Linux containerized environment (/home/user/claude/ or /tmp/claude-0/). Project now runs on Windows at C:/Users/MarkusAhling/pro/claude. These paths no longer exist.
- **Prevention:** Always use absolute Windows paths (C:/Users/MarkusAhling/pro/claude/...). Never use /home/user/claude/ paths.

### Error: Read failure (2026-03-08T19:57:35Z)
- **Tool:** Read
- **Input:** `C:\Users\MarkusAhling\.claude\plugins\cache\temp_local_1772999716991_weywmo\.claude-plugin\plugin.json`
- **Error:** File does not exist. Note: your current working directory is c:\Users\MarkusAhling\pro\claude.
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Fix:** Firecrawl hit redirect limit on target URL. Likely a redirect loop or bot-protection on the target site.
- **Prevention:** If firecrawl fails with redirect errors, try Perplexity MCP for the same information, or target a direct docs URL rather than a marketing/landing page.

### Error: Python iterating dict keys as objects
- **Tool:** Bash (python3 -c)
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Fix:** `plugins.index.json` has `"installed"` as dict (keys=names), not list of objects
- **Prevention:** Check JSON structure before assuming list/dict shape. Use `for k, v in d.items()`

### Error: Bash failure (2026-02-28T02:07:55Z)

SyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 45)
- **Status:** RESOLVED

- **Fix:** TypeScript strict mode (noUnusedLocals/noUnusedParameters) flagged unused variables/imports. Remove or prefix with _ to suppress.
- **Prevention:** Remove unused imports before committing. Prefix intentionally-unused variables with _ to satisfy strict mode.

### Error: Bash failure (2026-02-23T03:22:20Z)
- **Tool:** Bash
- **Input:** `npx tsc --noEmit --strict ... plugins/marketplace-pro/src/composition/engine.ts`
- **Error:** Cannot find module 'fs' or its corresponding type declarations
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Fix:** Same as federation module — root tsconfig lacks @types/node. Plugin TS files are reference implementations not compiled by root build.
- **Prevention:** Do not type-check plugin Node.js TS files with the root tsconfig.

### Error: Bash failure (2026-04-07T01:35:44Z)

- **Error:** Exit code 1
error TS5112: tsconfig.json is present but will not be loaded if files are specified on commandline. Use '--ignoreConfig' to skip this error.
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Fix:** When a tsconfig.json exists in the plugin directory, you cannot specify individual files on the tsc command line (TS5112). Run `npx tsc --noEmit` from the plugin directory to use its tsconfig, or use `--ignoreConfig` (which was invalid — use the whole-project check instead).
- **Prevention:** For plugins with their own tsconfig.json, always run `cd plugin-dir && npx tsc --noEmit` rather than passing individual file paths to tsc.

### Error: WebFetch failure (2026-03-08T07:35:15Z)
- **Tool:** WebFetch
- **Input:** `N/A`
- **Error:** Request failed with status code 404
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Fix:** WebFetch returned HTTP error (404/403/503) or content limit exceeded. URL was unavailable, moved, or access-restricted.
- **Prevention:** Use MCP tools instead of WebFetch: Perplexity MCP for knowledge queries, Firecrawl MCP for page scraping, Context7 MCP for library docs.

### Error: Task resume on running agent
- **Tool:** Task
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Fix:** Cannot resume a still-running agent — must wait for completion or stop it first
- **Prevention:** Check agent status before attempting resume

### Error: Git push rejected (remote ahead)
- **Tool:** Bash
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Fix:** Use `git stash && git pull --rebase origin <branch> && git stash pop` when local has uncommitted changes and remote is ahead.
- **Prevention:** Always `git pull --rebase` before pushing. If unstaged changes exist, stash first.

Comprehensive Claude Code Expert plugin providing knowledge base and three operational commands:

- **`/cc-setup`** — Full-stack project analyzer and Claude Code configuration generator. Detects tech stack, package manager, monorepo structure, and auto-generates CLAUDE.md, hooks, agents, MCP config, and settings.json with a 0-100 audit score.
- **`/cc-memory`** — Three-tier memory system: structured rules (Tier 1), auto-memory files (Tier 2), and MCP-backed semantic memory (Tier 3). Includes rotation, multi-repo support, and lifecycle hooks.
- **`/cc-orchestrate`** — Multi-agent orchestration templates (builder-validator, qa-swarm, feature-squad, research-council, refactor-pipeline, pr-review-board, docs-sprint, continuous-monitor) with cost/model guidance.

### Knowledge Base (30 skills)
Covers SDK internals, CLI mechanics, permissions model, MCP protocol, hooks system, agent patterns, prompt engineering, cost optimization, and more.

### Latest Changes (code review fixes)
- **Security**: Fixed heredoc injection in lessons-learned-capture.sh (sanitized inputs, flock for atomic writes)
- **Security**: Fixed JSON injection in security-guard.sh (use jq for safe JSON construction)
- **Security**: Added path traversal protection in auto-format.sh (realpath validation)
- **Correctness**: Moved error capture hook from PostToolUse to PostToolUseFailure
- **Correctness**: Fixed tsc single-file mode (now runs whole-project check filtered by changed file)
- **Correctness**: Removed nonexistent npm packages, restructured around official @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory
- **Correctness**: Replaced WebSearch/WebFetch with MCP tools in research-council template
- **Completeness**: Added missing on-stop.sh implementation, PostToolUseFailure to events table
- **Accuracy**: Corrected 7 MCP package names to verified npm registry names
- **Accuracy**: Fixed agent count mismatches in orchestration comparison table

## Test plan
- [ ] Verify `/cc-setup --audit` runs against a sample project without errors
- [ ] Verify `/cc-memory --dry-run` shows correct tier recommendations
- [ ] Verify `/cc-orchestrate --dry-run --template builder-validator` produces valid plan
- [ ] Confirm all hook scripts in cc-setup.md output valid JSON
- [ ] Confirm MCP package names resolve on npm registry

- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Fix:** The curl command used a local proxy (127.0.0.1:63703) specific to the containerized environment. The proxy was not authenticated and the GitHub API response was empty JSON, causing a KeyError. This proxy no longer exists.
- **Prevention:** Use gh CLI or GitHub MCP tools for GitHub API calls. Do not depend on container-specific local proxies.

Node.js v24.14.1

- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Fix:** Bash interprets backslash sequences inside double-quoted node -e strings, mangling the Windows path. Solution: use forward-slash paths (C:/Dev/repos/...) in a minified single-line node -e command — no backslash escaping needed.
- **Prevention:** Never embed backslash Windows paths in double-quoted bash strings for node -e. Use forward slashes or write a temp JS file.

- **Tool:** mcp__github__actions_list
- **Input:** `N/A`
- **Error:** missing required parameter: method
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Fix:** The GitHub MCP `actions_list` tool requires a `method` parameter (e.g. `list_workflow_runs`, `list_workflows`). Re-called with `method: "list_workflow_runs"` plus `owner`/`repo`/`branch`.
- **Prevention:** GitHub MCP "read" tools are multiplexed behind a `method` discriminator (same as `pull_request_read`, `issue_read`, `actions_get`). Always pass `method`. Note: `list_workflow_runs` can return very large payloads — it may exceed the token limit and get saved to a file; parse that file with `node -e` rather than reading it inline.

grep: site/index.html: No such file or directory
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Fix:** A previous Bash command ran `cd /home/user/claude/site` to start a local node server; the Bash tool's working directory persists across calls, so the later relative path `site/index.html` resolved to `site/site/index.html`. Re-ran with an absolute path / from the repo root.
- **Prevention:** The Bash tool shares one persistent cwd across calls. Avoid `cd` into a subdir for one-off commands — prefer absolute paths (or `node -e` with absolute paths, or `git -C <repo>`). If a server must run from a dir, start it with `(cd dir && …)` in a subshell so the parent cwd is unchanged, or `cd` back afterward.

### Error: Bash failure (2026-06-23T17:38:03Z)
- **Tool:** Bash
- **Input:** `grep -n 'card__details\|card.is-open\|card__detailsinner\|^\.kv\|card__desc' site/assets/styles.css`
- **Error:** Exit code 2
grep: site/assets/styles.css: No such file or directory
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Fix:** Same persistent-cwd cause as the entry above (shell still in `site/`). Switched to the Grep tool with an absolute path, which is also the preferred tool for content search.
- **Prevention:** Prefer the Grep/Glob tools over shell `grep`/`find`; when shelling out, use absolute paths because the Bash cwd persists between calls.

### Error: mcp__github__actions_get failure (2026-06-23T17:50:31Z)
- **Tool:** mcp__github__actions_get
- **Input:** `N/A`
- **Error:** missing required parameter: resource_id
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Fix:** `actions_get` requires both `method` and `resource_id` (not `run_id`). To read failing job logs, the simpler path is `mcp__github__get_job_logs` with `run_id` + `failed_only: true` to find the failed job id, then call it again with that `job_id` and `return_content: true` + `tail_lines`.
- **Prevention:** For CI log triage use `get_job_logs` (run_id → failed_only, then job_id → return_content), not `actions_get`. Reserve `actions_get` for run/workflow metadata and always pass `method` + `resource_id`.

### Error: js-yaml v5 upgrade broke ESM import and index check (2026-07-11T20:00:00Z)
- **Tool:** Bash
- **Input:** `pnpm add -D js-yaml@^5.2.1 && pnpm check:plugin-indexes`
- **Error:** `SyntaxError: The requested module 'js-yaml' does not provide an export named 'default'`; after switching to a namespace import, generate-plugin-indexes.mjs --check failed because js-yaml v5's `dump` serializes frontmatter differently than v4, mismatching every generated frontmatter block on disk.
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Fix:** Reverted to js-yaml@^4.1.1 (default export restored, dump output matches committed frontmatter). Kept the other dep upgrades (typescript 7.0.2, tsx 4.23 → esbuild 0.28.1 clearing all audit vulnerabilities, ajv 8.20).
- **Prevention:** js-yaml v5 is ESM-only (named exports) and changes dump formatting. Upgrading it requires (a) `import * as yaml` or named imports in scripts/*.mjs AND (b) regenerating frontmatter across all plugin command/agent files in the same commit (`pnpm generate:plugin-indexes`), accepting a ~300-file churn. Don't bump it casually.

### Error: mcp__github__get_check_run failure (2026-07-11T20:06:25Z)
- **Tool:** mcp__github__get_check_run
- **Input:** `method: list_check_runs, ref: <sha>`
- **Error:** owner, repo, and checkRunId are required
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Fix:** `get_check_run` fetches ONE check run by `checkRunId` — it has no list mode. To see CI status for a commit/branch, use `actions_list` with `method: "list_workflow_runs"` + `branch`, then parse the oversized saved payload with `node -e` (filter by `head_sha`, print name/status/conclusion).
- **Prevention:** For "is CI green on this sha" questions, go straight to `actions_list` → saved-file parse. Reserve `get_check_run` for drilling into a single known check-run ID.

### Error: bash-safety-validator blocks recursive-force delete even on scratchpad paths (2026-08-13T05:05:00Z)
- **Tool:** Bash
- **Input:** `<recursive force delete> /tmp/claude-0/.../scratchpad/expenses && node scripts/scaffold-app.mjs ...`
- **Error:** `PreToolUse:Bash hook error: BLOCKED: Destructive system command detected`
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Fix:** `.claude/hooks/bash-safety-validator.sh` pattern-matches the recursive-force delete flags regardless of target path, so it fires even on session scratchpad directories. Scaffolded into a fresh sibling directory (`expenses2`, `v2-<template>`) instead of deleting and recreating.
- **Prevention:** When iterating on a generator/scaffolder that refuses to write into a non-empty directory, never reach for a recursive delete. Write to a new uniquely-named directory each run, or give the tool a `--force` flag that overwrites in place. Note the hook also inspects heredoc *content* — a command whose body merely mentions those flags (e.g. appending this very lesson) is blocked too; use the Write/Edit tools for that text instead of `cat <<EOF`.

### Error: pnpm run script failed with node_modules missing on a fresh remote clone (2026-08-13T05:12:00Z)
- **Tool:** Bash
- **Input:** `pnpm generate:plugin-indexes`
- **Error:** `Cannot find package 'js-yaml'` → exit 1, with `WARN Local package.json exists, but node_modules missing, did you mean to install?`
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Fix:** Ran `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` first (~2s given the committed lockfile), then the script succeeded.
- **Prevention:** Claude Code on the web clones the repo fresh with no `node_modules`. In a remote session, run `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` before the first `pnpm check:*` / `generate:*` command. Scripts with zero runtime dependencies (plain `node scripts/foo.mjs`) work without it — only the ones importing `js-yaml`/`ajv`/`tsx` need the install.

### Error: new plugins invisible despite passing every validator (2026-08-17T00:00:00Z)
- **Tool:** N/A (diagnostic)
- **Input:** `pnpm check:marketplace` → 38/38 valid, yet `mcp-apps-studio` and `github-orchestrator` appeared nowhere in the registry or the site.
- **Error:** Adding a plugin to `plugins/` + `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` passes all four validators while leaving two downstream surfaces stale: `.claude/registry/plugins.index.json` (36 of 38) and `site/data/plugins.json` (36 of 38).
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Fix:** Added CATEGORY entries in `scripts/build-site.mjs`, re-ran `pnpm build:site`, and appended `installed` / `registry` / `plugins.<bucket>` entries plus recomputed `stats` in `plugins.index.json`.
- **Prevention:** `.claude/registry/plugins.index.json` has **no generator** — `generate-plugin-indexes.mjs` only writes per-plugin `commands/index.json` and `agents/index.json`. It is hand-maintained and drifts silently; no `check:*` script verifies it against `plugins/`. When adding a plugin, update four places: (1) the plugin dir, (2) `marketplace.json`, (3) the `CATEGORY` map in `scripts/build-site.mjs` then re-run `pnpm build:site`, (4) `plugins.index.json` (`installed`, `registry`, a `plugins.<bucket>` entry, and `stats`). Note `site/data/plugins.json` is a **committed build artifact** — stale until `build:site` runs. Also: the site keys off the *manifest* `name`, not the directory name (`claude-code-templating-plugin` ships `"name": "claude-code-templating"`), so compare manifest names when auditing coverage or you will chase false positives. A plugin missing from `CATEGORY` still builds but silently lands in an "Other" bucket.

### Error: Bash failure (2026-09-08T18:09:29Z)
- **Tool:** Bash
- **Input:** `cd plugins/linear-orchestrator && cat .claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- **Error:** Exit code 1
/bin/bash: line 2: cd: plugins/linear-orchestrator: No such file or directory
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Fix:** Re-ran with an absolute path from the repo root.

A second contributor was `ls` on a non-existent directory returning exit 2 even with `2>/dev/null`.
- **Prevention:** Never rely on the cwd persisting as you expect. Use absolute paths (or `git -C <repo>`) for every Bash call, wrap one-off `cd` in a subshell `(cd dir && ...)`, and append `|| true` to `ls`/`grep` whose target may legitimately be absent.

- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Fix:** Re-ran with an absolute path from the repo root. All of these were the same root cause: the Bash tool keeps ONE cwd across calls, and a `cd` in an earlier command silently relocated later relative paths. A second contributor was `ls` on a non-existent directory returning exit 2 even with `2>/dev/null`.
- **Prevention:** Never rely on the cwd persisting as you expect. Use absolute paths (or `git -C <repo>`) for every Bash call, wrap one-off `cd` in a subshell `(cd dir && ...)`, and append `|| true` to `ls`/`grep` whose target may legitimately be absent.

Node.js v22.22.2
- **Status:** RESOLVED
- **Fix:** `node -e` evaluates as CommonJS, where top-level `await` and `import` are syntax errors. Re-ran with `node --input-type=module -e` and static `import` statements.
- **Prevention:** To exercise a plugin ESM module (`lib/*.mjs`) from Bash, always use `node --input-type=module -e 'import {x} from "./lib/y.mjs"; ...'`. Use plain `node -e` only for CommonJS work such as `require("fs")` and JSON parsing. Note the two cannot be mixed: `require` is undefined under `--input-type=module`.
