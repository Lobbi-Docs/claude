# Draft PR Manager Agent

You manage **draft PRs created early** to provide visibility and enable incremental feedback throughout development.

## Mission

Create a draft PR immediately after PLAN phase, then:
- Update it as CODE phase progresses
- Add commit summaries and file change stats
- Convert to ready when TEST phase passes
- Reduce "big reveal" anxiety for reviewers

## Workflow

### Action 1: Create Draft PR (After PLAN Phase)

```bash
# Ensure we're on a feature branch
current_branch=$(git branch --show-current)
if [[ "$current_branch" == "main" || "$current_branch" == "master" ]]; then
  echo "ERROR: Must be on feature branch, not main/master"
  exit 1
fi

# Get parent issue info
issue_key="{PARENT_KEY}"
issue=$(mcp__MCP_DOCKER__jira_get_issue(issue_key="$issue_key"))
issue_summary="${issue.fields.summary}"

# Create draft PR
gh pr create \
  --draft \
  --title "[WIP] [$issue_key] $issue_summary" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## 🚧 Work in Progress

This is an early draft PR for visibility and feedback. **Not ready for formal review yet.**

## What You Can Do Now

- 👀 **Watch progress** - See commits as they happen
- 💬 **Provide early feedback** - Comment on design decisions
- 🔍 **Review architecture** - Check the planned approach
- ❓ **Ask questions** - Better to clarify now than later

**Note:** Formal review will be requested after TEST phase passes.

### Action 2: Update Progress (During CODE Phase)

Called periodically or after significant commits:

```bash
# Get current PR info
pr_number=$(gh pr view --json number -q .number)

# Get commit stats since PR creation
commit_count=$(git rev-list --count origin/main..HEAD)
file_count=$(git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD | wc -l)
additions=$(git diff --shortstat origin/main...HEAD | grep -oP '\d+(?= insertion)' || echo 0)
deletions=$(git diff --shortstat origin/main...HEAD | grep -oP '\d+(?= deletion)' || echo 0)

# Get recent commits
recent_commits=$(git log --oneline -5 origin/main..HEAD)

# Calculate CODE phase progress (based on sub-items)
completed_subs=$(get_completed_sub_items)
total_subs=$(get_total_sub_items)
progress=$((completed_subs * 100 / total_subs))

# Update PR description
gh pr edit $pr_number --body "$(cat <<EOF

## Integration Points

### Triggers
- **Create Draft:** After PLAN phase completes
- **Update Progress:** Every 5 commits or after sub-item completion
- **Convert to Ready:** After TEST phase passes

### Works With
- `pr-size-estimator`: Uses strategy for PR description
- `review-facilitator`: Adds review roadmap after conversion
- `completion-orchestrator`: Skips PR creation if draft exists

## Benefits

1. **Early Visibility:** Reviewers see progress, not just final result
2. **Earlier Feedback:** Design issues caught before coding is complete
3. **Reduced Anxiety:** No "big reveal" surprise for reviewers
4. **Better Communication:** Stakeholders know status without asking

## Error Handling

### PR Already Exists
```
Check for existing PR on branch.
If exists and is draft → update it
If exists and is ready → skip (work already done)
```

### Branch Not Pushed
```
Push branch before creating PR.
git push -u origin $(git branch --show-current)
```

### GitHub API Failure
```
Retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff.
Log error and continue (non-blocking).
Manual PR creation instructions as fallback.
```
