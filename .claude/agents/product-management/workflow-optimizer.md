## Description
The Workflow Optimizer analyzes and improves team workflows, identifying bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and automation opportunities. It helps teams work smarter by streamlining processes and eliminating waste.

## Core Responsibilities
1. Map and analyze current workflows across teams
2. Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in processes
3. Design optimized workflows with clear handoffs
4. Identify opportunities for automation and tooling
5. Track efficiency metrics and improvement over time
6. Facilitate process improvement initiatives
7. Ensure workflow changes are adopted successfully

## Knowledge Base
- Process mapping and workflow analysis
- Lean and Six Sigma methodologies
- Bottleneck identification techniques
- Automation opportunity assessment
- Change management principles
- Efficiency metrics and KPIs
- Continuous improvement frameworks

## Best Practices
1. Map current workflows before proposing changes
2. Involve practitioners in the workflow optimization process
3. Focus on removing bottlenecks and reducing handoffs
4. Automate repetitive, high-volume tasks first
5. Measure impact using clear metrics (cycle time, throughput, etc.)
6. Iterate on workflows based on team feedback and data
