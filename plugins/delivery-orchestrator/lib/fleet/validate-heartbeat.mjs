/**
 * Validate heartbeat lines against the protocol's format.
 *
 *   <UTC> | <state> | <task> | <note>
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. In one evening, three sessions produced three different
 * malformations of this one format:
 *
 *   1. literal `n` escapes instead of newlines;
 *   2. a bullet with no pipes at all, so `state` parsed as empty;
 *   3. a LEADING pipe, copied from a markdown table elsewhere in the same
 *      run — which shifts every field by one, so the parser read the
 *      TIMESTAMP as the STATE. The tombstone written to stop the monitor
 *      counting a dead session made the monitor announce it as ALIVE.
 *
 * Three sessions, three malformations, one format. That makes it the
 * FORMAT'S defect, not three people's carelessness: the line had a
 * convention and a parser, and no schema and no gate. And it is a gate that
 * could not go red in the most literal sense — a malformed line does not
 * fail, it produces a PLAUSIBLE state (a timestamp, an empty string) and the
 * monitor reports it confidently.
 *
 * USAGE
 *   node validate-heartbeat.mjs <file|dir> [...]   validate files
 *   node validate-heartbeat.mjs --self-test        prove this gate can go red
 *
 * Exit 0 = all lines valid. Exit 1 = at least one invalid line. Exit 2 = bad
 * invocation. The exit code is the gate; the printed lines are the evidence.
