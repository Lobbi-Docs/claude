# /mui-fingerprint

Fingerprint an app, ask questions, then build every component it needs.

## Operating Protocol

### Phase 1 — Deep Scan (Fingerprinting)

Scan the project to understand what exists and what's missing.

#### 1.1 — Tech Stack Detection

```bash
# Framework
grep -l "next" package.json             # Next.js
grep -l "vite" package.json             # Vite
grep -l "react-scripts" package.json    # CRA

# MUI version and packages
grep -E '"@mui/(material|system|x-data-grid|x-date-pickers|x-charts)"' package.json

# Styling approach
grep -rl "styled(" src/                 # styled() usage
grep -rl "sx={{" src/                   # sx prop usage
grep -rl "makeStyles\|withStyles" src/  # deprecated patterns
grep -rl "className=" src/ | head -5    # Tailwind/CSS modules

# State management
grep -l "zustand\|@reduxjs/toolkit\|recoil\|jotai\|@tanstack/react-query" package.json

# Form library
grep -l "react-hook-form\|formik\|@hookform" package.json

# Router
grep -l "react-router\|next/router\|next/navigation" package.json
```

#### 1.2 — Existing Component Inventory

```bash
# MUI components in use
grep -roh "from '@mui/material/[A-Z][^']*'" src/ | sort -u | wc -l

# List all unique MUI component imports
grep -roh "from '@mui/material/[A-Z][^']*'" src/ | sort -u

# MUI X components
grep -roh "from '@mui/x-[^']*'" src/ | sort -u

# Custom components (project's own)
find src/components -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.jsx" | sort

# Pages/routes
find src/pages -name "*.tsx" 2>/dev/null || find src/app -name "page.tsx" 2>/dev/null
```

#### 1.3 — Theme Analysis

```bash
# Theme file
find src -name "theme*" -o -name "Theme*" | head -5

# ThemeProvider usage
grep -rn "ThemeProvider\|CssVarsProvider" src/ | head -3

# CssBaseline
grep -rn "CssBaseline" src/ | head -3

# Dark mode
grep -rn "palette.mode\|colorSchemes\|useColorScheme\|ColorModeContext" src/ | head -5
```

#### 1.4 — API / Data Layer Detection

```bash
# API calls
grep -roh "fetch(\|axios\.\|useSWR\|useQuery" src/ | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn

# API routes (Next.js)
find src/app/api -name "route.ts" 2>/dev/null | head -20

# Data models / types
find src -name "*.types.ts" -o -name "types.ts" -o -name "*.model.ts" | head -10
```

### Phase 2 — Interactive Questions

Based on the scan, ask targeted questions using AskUserQuestion. Adapt questions to
what was found vs what's missing.

**Always ask:**
1. "What is this app? Describe the main purpose in 1-2 sentences."
2. "Who are the primary users? (admin, end-user, both, internal team)"

**Ask based on gaps detected:**

If **no layout/navigation found**:
3. "What navigation pattern do you want? (sidebar+appbar / top-nav / tabs / bottom-nav-mobile)"
4. "How many main sections/pages does the app have? List them."

If **no forms found**:
5. "What are the main data entry forms? (e.g., user registration, settings, create order)"
6. "Do forms need multi-step wizards or single-page layout?"

If **no data tables found**:
7. "What data lists/tables are needed? (e.g., user list, order list, product catalog)"
8. "Do tables need inline editing, filtering, export?"

If **no feedback components found**:
9. "How should the app communicate status? (toast/snackbar, inline alerts, dialog confirmations)"

If **no theme customization found**:
10. "Do you have brand colors? (primary hex, secondary hex)"
11. "Do you need dark mode support?"

If **no auth/access UI found**:
12. "Does the app have login/signup pages?"
13. "Are there role-based access differences in the UI?"

**Ask about quality level:**
14. "How polished should components be? (functional-first / production-quality / highly-creative)"

### Phase 3 — Component Gap Analysis

Build a comprehensive list of needed components by category:

```
## Component Gap Analysis

### Layout (priority: critical)
- [ ] AppShell (AppBar + Drawer + main content area)
- [ ] ResponsiveDrawer (mobile temporary, desktop permanent)
- [ ] PageContainer (consistent padding, max-width, breadcrumbs)

### Navigation (priority: critical)
- [ ] MainNav (sidebar items with icons, active state, router integration)
- [ ] Breadcrumbs (auto-generated from route)
- [ ] TabNavigation (for section sub-navigation)

### Data Display (priority: high)
- [ ] DataTable (reusable DataGrid wrapper with server-side fetch)
- [ ] StatCard (KPI card with trend indicator)
- [ ] DetailPanel (expandable row detail)

### Forms (priority: high)
- [ ] FormField (unified wrapper for TextField/Select/DatePicker + RHF)
- [ ] EntityForm (metadata-driven form from API schema)
- [ ] SearchBar (debounced Autocomplete with recent searches)
- [ ] FilterBar (multi-field filter panel)

### Feedback (priority: medium)
- [ ] ConfirmDialog (reusable confirmation with severity)
- [ ] ToastProvider (Snackbar queue with severity)
- [ ] LoadingOverlay (Backdrop + CircularProgress)
- [ ] EmptyState (illustrated empty state with action button)
- [ ] ErrorBoundary (with MUI Alert fallback)

### Auth (priority: depends)
- [ ] LoginForm (email/password + social)
- [ ] SignupForm (multi-step registration)
- [ ] ForgotPasswordForm
- [ ] ProtectedRoute (role-based access wrapper)

### Dashboard (priority: depends)
- [ ] DashboardGrid (responsive stat cards + charts layout)
- [ ] ChartCard (reusable chart container with title/subtitle)
- [ ] ActivityFeed (timeline of recent events)

### Settings (priority: low)
- [ ] SettingsLayout (tabs or accordion sections)
- [ ] ProfileForm (avatar upload + fields)
- [ ] PreferencesForm (switches, selects for user prefs)
- [ ] ThemeToggle (dark/light/system mode switcher)
```

### Phase 4 — Build Components

For each checked item, generate the component following these rules:

1. **Detect project conventions** — match existing import style, file structure, naming
2. **Use theme tokens** — never hardcode colors, use `theme.palette.*`, `theme.spacing()`
3. **Full TypeScript** — exported props interface, proper generics
4. **Accessibility** — ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus management
5. **Responsive** — useMediaQuery or responsive sx for all layout components
6. **Dark mode safe** — semantic palette tokens, no hardcoded hex
7. **Match --style level**:
   - `minimal`: functional, clean, no animations
   - `standard`: polished, subtle hover/focus effects, proper spacing
   - `premium`: refined transitions, loading states, skeleton placeholders, empty states
   - `creative`: fluid animations, gradient accents, glassmorphism, micro-interactions

**Build order** (dependencies first):
1. Theme (if missing)
2. Layout shell (AppBar, Drawer, PageContainer)
3. Navigation (sidebar items, breadcrumbs)
4. Reusable primitives (FormField, DataTable, ConfirmDialog, ToastProvider)
5. Page-specific components (forms, tables, dashboards)
6. Polish components (empty states, error boundaries, loading overlays)

### Phase 5 — Wire Up

After building components:
1. Integrate layout shell into app root (layout.tsx or App.tsx)
2. Add navigation items matching detected/specified pages
3. Wire ToastProvider at app root
4. Add ThemeProvider if missing
5. Update barrel exports if project uses them

### Phase 6 — Report

```
## Fingerprint Report

### App Profile
- Framework: [detected]
- MUI version: [detected]
- Styling: [sx / styled / Tailwind / mixed]
- State: [React Query / Zustand / Redux / Context]
- Forms: [RHF / Formik / controlled]
- Router: [Next.js App / Pages / React Router]

### Scan Results
- Existing MUI components: X unique imports
- Existing custom components: X files
- Pages/routes: X
- Theme: [found / missing]
- Dark mode: [yes / no]

### Components Built
| Component | Category | Lines | Status |
|-----------|----------|-------|--------|
| AppShell  | Layout   | 120   | created |
| DataTable | Display  | 200   | created |
| ...       | ...      | ...   | ...     |

Total: X components, ~Y lines of code
```

## Quality Bar

Before declaring done:
- [ ] All components render without TypeScript errors
- [ ] All interactive elements have accessible names
- [ ] All layout components are responsive (mobile + desktop)
- [ ] All colors use theme palette tokens (no hardcoded hex)
- [ ] Theme has CssBaseline + ThemeProvider/CssVarsProvider
- [ ] Navigation integrates with router
- [ ] Forms have validation wired
- [ ] Data tables have loading/empty/error states
